# **App Name**: TaskFlow Kanban

## Core Features:

- Task Movement: Enable drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between columns representing different stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- Task Editing: Implement a modal or panel that opens when a task is clicked, allowing users to view and edit the task description.
- AI Tag Suggestion: Suggest relevant tags or labels for tasks based on their description using a tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for background to provide a clean, neutral canvas.
- Secondary color: White (#FFFFFF) for task cards and containers to create visual separation.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements like buttons and highlights, providing a sense of calmness and efficiency.
- Use a horizontal layout with columns for each stage (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- Use simple, clear icons to represent task status or priority.
- Use subtle animations for drag-and-drop interactions to provide visual feedback.

## Original User Request:
Make me a javascript jira clone where you can move tasks between columns. Each task can be clicked on and opened up to edit the description.
